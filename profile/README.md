# **🪐 swap.wtf — QuantumTokenTeleporters for DeFi Degenomics**

"Swap whatever you want... but only whenever you want to. Now with extra sauce!"

Welcome to **swap.wtf**, where we don’t just swap tokens — we *reboot liquidity*. This is the official GitHub home for the **Quantum Swapper Multiverse**, a decentralized suite of token teleporter contracts and hyperdegenerate UIs built to save you from your bags — one swap at a time.

---

## **💡 What Is This?**

We’re forking Uniswap, injecting it with a **3% spicy sauce tax**, integrating 0xSplits Swapper tech, and slapping on a next-gen interface with **"teleport your tokens into the unknown"** vibes.

At its core, swap.wtf is:

* 🔁 A batch swapper to **nuke your trash bag into your favorite degen token**

* 🧠 A reactive UI where **chaos meets clarity**

* 🌀 A Uniswap fork with a twist: **every swap supports the cause**

* ⚡️ A launchpad for onchain memeconomies and community-led market making

## **🧱 Repo Structure**

We divide our repos by **layer** and **energy level**:

### **`🧠 brain/`**

High-IQ smart contracts and tokenomics logic:

* `swapper-core` — remix of 0xSplits swapper contracts

* `uniswap-wtf` — spicy fork of Uniswap v2/v3 with a 3% built-in fee

* `wtf-treasury` — auto-split fee router \+ tokenomics

### **`🖥 frontend/`**

The interfaces and flows:

* `swap-ui` — main QuantumTokenTeleporter interface

* `pro-mode` — advanced user Pro Mode™ for routing nerds

* `bonkerbar` — meme ticker bar, sponsored slot SDK

### **`🛰 infra/`**

Edge infra for multichain swaps and UI syncing:

* `token-indexer` — RPC & offchain engine to detect trashbags

* `oracle-watcher` — Chainlink \+ TWAP combo oracles

* `gas-bouncer` — slippage \+ gas estimator & "bribe router"

### **🧠 Phase II – Smart Phase**

* 🧮 Token tax detection & MEV mitigation

* 🛠 Open SDK for deploying your own forked Swapper

### **🌌 Phase III – Galactic Phase**
